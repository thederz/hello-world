I have long been an explorer but now I can call myself a "traveler" too.
Explorers are not like other people. They don't perceive risk the same way. They are more apt to chase lost causes.
And this pusuit of risk, of the impossible, invariably leads to higher highs and lower lows. But, in the end, they have no choice. They didn't choose to be explorers; that's just the way they were born.
Still, isn't living life fully -- the good, the bad, and the ugly -- what it's all about?
Remember, you only get to do this once. There are no re-do's in the game of life.
